# XXX QUESTIONS â€” for professor mullen
# how can we determine the number of files in a given torrent based on the test.torrent meta-info?

# You state that we must manipulate the OrderedDict to produce the info_hash :
# """
# You'll need to get the info directory, re-encode it
# into bencode, then encrypt it with SHA1 using the
# hashlib library and generate a digest.
# """
# For this operation, should we take the OrderedDict containing the byte literals (notated with b'')?
    #  OR
# should we instead re-encode the decoded OrderedDictionary to to generate the info_hash?
